        <h2 class="w3-center">Our History</h2>
        <p>Pamantasang Augernaut (AgU) was originally established as a Greek-run school with a strong emphasis on science, philosophy, and mathematics. Over the decades, the university evolved, embracing a Catholic and Vincentian identity under the Congregation of the Mission. This transformation strengthened its mission to provide high-quality education that is both accessible and affordable to students from all walks of life.</p>

                    Augernaut University has endured the tests of history, first as a Greek-run school. It has emerged academically richer and stronger, accumulating layers of knowledge and experience that sustain its mission to provide educationâ€”the kind that meets stringent standards of quality yet remains affordable.
